  Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting modern society.
  On top of this, its effects and the effects of the wider concept of dementia are also very acute and particular in the way how they affect both patients and their loved ones.
  Aiming to push forward the prospects for early detection of the disease, in this thesis I~present the possibilities of using machine learning methods to detect Alzheimer's disease and the stages of dementia associated with it.
  For this purpose, I~use machine learning tools available in the \emph{.NET} environment, which has been completely neglected by the academic community, while it is very popular in medical or hospital systems, where potentially such diagnostic systems can be used.
  I~compare two popular machine learning tools -- the libraries called \emph{ML.NET} and \emph{TensorFlow.NET}.
  I~use them to perform transfer learning and using deep convolutional neural networks, I~carry out their training and test on a~dataset of brain MRI images of healthy subjects and those with Alzheimer's disease and varying stages of dementia.
  The best of the trained model achieves an accuracy of $85\%$ for classifying the stage of dementia, which is not a~bad result, although alternatives emerging in recent years are already performing much better.
  I~also present the advantages and disadvantages of the tools used and the potential for future development.
